## A Feasibility Study into Utilising Machine Learning to Select Quadcopter Components
The University of Sydney - School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering

Supervised by Dr Zihao Wang


## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide an insight into source code for the project. This involves all aspects of the experimentation phase. Each phase will be placed in its own folder. Additional resources will be included including code output.


## Folders
1. Data Scraping - This folder contains the data scraping scripts that were utilised to iteratively query and extract data from an online evaluation calculator.

2. Data Processing - This folder contains scripts that were used to combine different datasets into one dataset for processing, as well as conducting data manipulation to remove invalid data

3. Machine Learning - This folder contains the scripts that were used to conduct machine learning analysis.

4. Figures and Outputs - This folder contains various figures utilised from all the different scripts, as well as files output from those scripts

## Notes
- Please note that utilising all the scripts from this Repository will not lead to any functionality. Data in this GitHub Repository was manually duplicated and restructured into this filing system, and as such, functionality is not guaranteed.

- Some aspects of the code may be redacted for privacy reasons.
